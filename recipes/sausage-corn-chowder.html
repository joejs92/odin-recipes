    <!--Add an image of the finished product here.-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is a particular favorite of mine. Though perhaps
        not a 'traditional' chowder, it is delicious,
        simple to make, and does not take much time or too 
        many ingredients. Perhaps the most marvelous aspect
        of this recipe is that it serves as a template for 
        chowders. The reader can at the appropriate stage 
        substitute the sausage or corn for whichever protein 
        and/or vegetable he or she desires.Also, a fish 
        stock is preferrable if the protein is seafood.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbs Butter</li>
        <li>1 Tbs cooking oil</li>
        <li>3 cups of diced onions</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup of flour</li>
        <li>4 cups of light chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 pound of chopped, peeled potatoes.</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups of milk or light cream</li>
        <li>1 package of Italian sausages</li>
        <li>2 cups of frozen corn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep. Gather all ingredients. Peel and chop 
            potatoes and onions. Remove sausages from cases.
        </li>
        <li>Heat stew pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat.
            Add cooking oil, then add sausages. Break up the 
            sausages into as small of pieces as possible while
            they cook. Once browned and partially cooked, remove 
            sausages to separate plate.
        </li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the pot. Stir in the onions and
            bay leaf. Saute over medium-low heat until onions 
            are tender and translucent which should take no more
            than 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the four cups of liquid to the pot. Bring to a 
            boil and let it simmer, loosely covered, until 
            potatoes are soft and easily pierced by a fork.
        </li>
        <li>Create a slurry with the flour and water. Add the 
            slurry to the pot and stir vigorously to prevent 
            clumps. Continue stirring until slurry is well 
            incorporated and the chowder thickens.
        </li>
        <li>Mix in the milk/cream, corn, and sausage. Bring 
            to a simmer for five minutes. While simmering, use a 
            potato masher to mash the potatoes in the pot into 
            smaller and more manageable chunks. Taste to correct
            seasoning.
        </li>
    </ol>
