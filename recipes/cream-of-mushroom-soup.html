    <h1>Cream of Mushroom Soup</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If one is looking for a dark, creamy soup that can comfort
        and warm a person on even the coldest of days, then look
        no further. This rich, full-bodied soup when paired with 
        a slice of fresh bread serves as either an appetizer or 
        full meal in itself. Either a dry red or dry white wine
        work with this recipe. I prefer the flavors of the red.
        It is also fun to note that this soup tastes better the 
        second day. Perhaps it is worthwhile to cook it for dinner
        the night before in order to fully enjoy it. It tastes 
        better than it looks, trust me.
